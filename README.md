# Open-sat
We're a group of teenagers hoping to be the youngest group of people to successfully launch a satelite into low earth orbit. Our satelite is called open-sat, because we are hoping to make it 100% open source.

It's designed to be the thinnest and cheapest satelite on the market, while still being functional.
